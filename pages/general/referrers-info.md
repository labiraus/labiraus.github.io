The main focus of Home-Start Nottingham's work is to offer informal, friendly and confidential support to families in their own homes through carefully selected and prepared volunteers, who are parents themselves.

## Home-Start's ethos and approach

Flexibility and openness to be led by the needs of families are at the heart of Home-Start Nottingham's approach.

Home-Start Nottingham offers support to families within their own home in a culturally sensitive way. Support is based on assessed need following discussion with the parents themselves.

## Frequently asked questions

We believe that talking to a person is one of the best ways of finding out about our service, or of raising any concerns. So in most cases we recommend that you speak to staff at your local Home-Start if there is anything you want to know.

But here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about our service:

### Who can be referred?

It is our aim at Home-Start Nottingham to operate an open referral policy ensuring that support is available to any family with children under the age of eight years old living in greater Nottingham, the boroughs of Rushcliffe, Ashfield, Gedling and Broxtowe.

### Who can make referrals?

Families can refer themselves, or be referred to Home-Start Nottingham by any agency, e.g. health visitor, social worker, family support worker, CPN, Children Centres, nursery teacher, etc in consultation with the family.

We only restrict referrals where there is a lack of resources.

### How do I make a referral?

Please contact the office on info@hsn.org.uk or phone 0115 962 4262 for a referral form. Once you have received the form, please fill it in completely and send back to info@hsn.org.uk. When the form is received a Co-ordinator from the office will be in contact with you.

Before sending in a referral form families must be consulted, informed of the content of the referral form and show their agreement by signing the form.

All referrals received will be assessed to determine:

Appropriateness of referral.

Whether there are volunteers available.

How soon a volunteer might be linked.

### What happens if a referral is refused?

If the referral does not fall within the remit of the scheme or there are insufficient resources to provide support, the referral will not be accepted and the referrer informed that Home-Start Nottingham can not help on this occasion. If it is possible to signpost a family to another service we will do this.

### What happens if a referral is accepted?

If the referral does not fall within the remit of the scheme or there are insufficient resources to provide support, the referral will not be accepted and the referrer informed that Home-Start Nottingham can not help on this occasion. If it is possible to signpost a family to another service we will do this.

### Do you have a waiting list?

Home-Start Nottingham aims to provide support to families either immediately or within a few weeks. We will take name and contacts details of the referrer and ask them to contact us in a month or if a volunteer becomes available we will contact them.

### How are volunteers matched with families?

The co-ordinator pays careful attention to matching volunteers skills and experience to the needs of families. Many factors are taken into consideration, including:

The family's needs.

The volunteer's aptitudes, skills and experience.

Practical considerations: geography, transport and time.

Mutual interests or life experience.

What motivates the volunteer.

Issues around culture, gender, background and disability.

The success of Home-Start Nottingham support is dependent on the relationship that develops between the family and the volunteer, so co-ordinators make every effort to link sensitively and appropriately.

The co-ordinator always accompanies the volunteer on the first visit to introduce the volunteer to the family and set the ground rules for visiting. The co-ordinator will stay as long as appropriate to support the family and volunteer to get to know each other.

### How long is support offered for?

Volunteers provide continuous, regular support for a period of time consistent with a family`s needs. These are assessed initially and reviewed at least every 3 months.

Home-Start Nottingham's aim is to encourage families towards independence so that the volunteer is no longer needed. The review process will determine how long the volunteer's support is likely to be needed and clear plans will be made for ending the support in discussion with the volunteer and family.

### Do you offer other support in addition to home visiting volunteers?

Families are sometimes offered support outside the home, which complements Home-Start Nottingham's core home visiting support, for example outings and parenting courses.

Please contact us for more information on the additional services we offer.

Parents respond to and appreciate Home-Start's approach to support outside the home and begin to enjoy playing and learning with their children in new ways as well as widening their social networks, sharing ideas, enjoying the company of others and having fun together. They value the opportunity to offer support to others and may gain greater self-confidence sometimes leading to taking up new opportunities including volunteering, employment, courses or further education.
